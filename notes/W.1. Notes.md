- Yield to maturity is just an alternative way of pricing a security.
- Spot curve is called like that because it is derived from spot assets (not futures, or other derivatives)
- Spot curve is also known as "discount curve"

### Questions:
- Prof. said that YTM is a way of normalizing coupons and maturity to compare apples to apples, but does it even make sense to compare two bonds, one maturing in 2 years, and another in 20 years, even using YTM?
- In the "why not bootstrap the entire curve", when you were saying about the multicollinearity, deleting entire dates, sudo inverse - could you elaborate more on that?
